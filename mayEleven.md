#### Overview and Learning
Throughout this week, I used my google docs list in order to create a basic HTML tutorial with several examples. As the week next week goes by, my goal is to continue adding to the growing list of examples, although I rather have less examples with greater, enriched explanation, than just a list of examples with little to no explanation. Rather than speak on what I've done, I rather display images. Moving forward the goal is to make the list grow as much, as fast as possible, while still maintaining good, detailed explanations, because we have all came across tutorials that have little to no context, and it just adds to our confusion.  <br>

#### Takeaways
My takeaways for this week (and life in general) is simple. Quality over Quantity. I rather have something very basic, that provides detailed explanations for limited examples over something that provides a plethora of examples with little to no explanation. Just like in life, perhaps it is better to be an expert in one thing, rather than being extremely average in a lot of things.
