##### Overview and Learning 
Researching or even getting near my computer throughout spring break was tough. One just wants to be at home or comfortable, but when I finally got on and began reading and looking up shell scripting, I found myself mostly on `"grep"`. And throughout this week, I haven't even began using shell scripting in my actual terminal, but my week consisted of reading through almost every single command. A lot were semi-diffucult to understand, and some were just impossible to read. For example there are different uses for grep, there are commands that allow you to work directly in the "File and Directory," those are easier to read and the explanations aren't as aggressive. `--exclude-from=file` This is one of those commands that are pretty much self-explanatory, and what that does is simply skips over files with similar patterns. But on the other hand, you have commands that deal with environment variables....I have no idea what this is... yet! it looks a little like this,
```
#! /bin/sh
export PATH=/usr/bin
exec grep --color=auto --devices=skip "$@"
```
###### Moving Forward
As our independent unit continues it looks like I have a lot of work to do. Setting a schedule would be ideal, but I don't believe it would be useful since shell scripting is all over the place, and since you can really move in what ever order to please. But as I go forward, my first priority is to figure out what exactly that line of code means becasue its been nagging me for about three days now. But most importantly, I want to decipher and breakdown the paragraphs that explain every command, becasue I feel like they provide explanations without giving context, and that is where my confusion stems from.
