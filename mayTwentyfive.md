#### Overview and Learning 
Throughout this week, my main focus was to continue the preparation for my presentation. Throughout the course of the week, I have been collecting screenshots of the examples that have been implemented in my tutorial, and I have been adding those into my "Google Slides" presentation. <br>

#### Takeaways
What I learned from this project was that dedication is greatly needed whenever you set out to do something bg yourself. The only person who can stand in ones way is yourself. Obstacles are inevitable, but when they do appear, you need to have confidence in yourself because at the end of the day, the only person who can truly help you is you.
